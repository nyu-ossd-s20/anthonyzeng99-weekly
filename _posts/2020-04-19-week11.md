# Reflections on Project Progress
In the previous weeks we've submitted two pull requests, both solving an issue from the issues page. One has received feedback previously 
and changes made but they've yet to provide further feedback or merge it in. The other pull request on fixing the BFS/DFS issues didn't really
have any substantive comments on it. This week I made a new pull request adding a new lesson in their section on Rosetta Code. That PR also
has yet to receive any comments. In our weekly meeting we dicussed our plans for the next few weeks. We decided we are going to focus on 
contributing Rosetta Code lessons because there seems to be many that are missing. We think this will allow us to get more done and make
a bigger impact on FreeCodeCamp rather than just waiting for issues to come up on the issues page.
