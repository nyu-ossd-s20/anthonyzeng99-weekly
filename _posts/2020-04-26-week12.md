# Reflections on Project Progress
We continued making progress with adding lessons to FreeCodeCamp. We are mostly working on the section on interview
questions, specifically Rosetta Code. FreeCodeCamp has some problems but are missing many of them, so we are working
on creating lessons for these missing problems. Kyla added the wiki for our project to the class wiki page. Anastasia
made a pull request for a FizzBuzz lesson. During our weekly meet-up we worked on preparing for our stand up on Monday.
We wrote up what were planning on saying during the standup and discussed how to approach the issue with opening up 
issues before making pull request for new lessons.
