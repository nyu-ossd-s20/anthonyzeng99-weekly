# Reflections on Other Group's Projects
All the groups had very interesting projects but my favorite was Lemy. I think it is a very interesting concept and as someone who goes on Reddit a
lot, to see if it takes off in the future. I liked that even thought the group was not familiar with Rust that they are taking this oppurtunity to learn
a new language. It is also nice to see that many groups have already been in contact with their respective communities and that many have also started
making contributions to their projects. It is good to see that their is a wide variety of goals in these projects from transparency in state governments
to creating interactive media.

# Reflections on Our Project
I think we've made good progress contributing to our project. We've made two pull requests that fixes two issues. We ran into the same problems with finding
issues to work with as the other group working on FreeCodeCamp. It is a big project with many contributors many issues are resolved very quickly. This leaves
us with issues that no one else wants to work on. We were lucky to find two that we were able to do. Our plan for the future is to instead of just focusing on
issues, to also start contributing new lessons to the project. We noticed that in the Coding Interview Prep section they take problems from Rosetta Code and Project
Euler. These sections are not yet complete so we thought we could contribute some lessons in those areas.
