# Reflections on Project Evaluation in Class
With the activity in class I learned more about different interesting open-source projects that I might be potentially interested in contributing to. I thought it 
was interesting that the NSA has an open-source tool for reverse engineering software. The project that our group was assigned was Godot, an open-source game engine.
Our project had extensive documentation and communities across most major platforms. I learned more in-depth what the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING and CODE-OF-CONDUCT
files were for and why there are important to open-source projects. 

# Reflections on Bloomberg Talk
I thought the speaker made interesting points regarding open-source software, but most of the information was not new to me as I interned at Bloomberg over the 
last summer. I thought it was interesting the extent of which open-source software has replcaed closed-source proprietary software within Bloomberg.
