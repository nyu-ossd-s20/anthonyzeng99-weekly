# Reflections on Group Discussion
During the first weekly meeting we discussed which of the open issues that we were interested in working on, our plan on getting familiarity 
with the project, and potentially adding new lessons. We found an open issue that dealt with a hash table lesson where one of the tests was 
passing even if the method was implemented incorrectly. We worked together on looking at the code and see what was wrong. We can up with a solution, 
tested it, and created a pull request.

# Reflections on First Pull Request
After editing the actual project with our fix we pushed it to our work of the repo and made a pull request with the original repo. Automated tests
were ran, which passed. Contributors made comments on how to improve our test and I'm currently working on implementing the suggestions.
