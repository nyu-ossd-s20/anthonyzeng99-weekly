# Groupwork on Browser Extensions

We completed most major functionality on the browser extension by the presentation date. We were sucessfully able to intercept the user's web request and redirect them to a page we created when they attempt to access a site that is blocked by the extension. We even implemented functionality that allows the user to enter custom sites that they want blocked. We however have not had the time to implement a button to delete these custom sites that he user has added. I have had experience working collabratively through GitHub before, but this is the first time I've used GitHub's interface for resolving merge conflict which is pretty neat. This is the first browser extension I've worked on so I'm glad I now have experience with that. If I decide I want to create a new browser extension in the future I will be more confident in doing so. Working on this project has cemented my preference for working on more back-end type stuff rather than front-end or graphic design work. I thought the other groups had some pretty cool extensions, some which I would've never come up with on my own. With more work, I could see many of our extensions actually being very useful for many people.
