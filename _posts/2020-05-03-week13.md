# Reflections on Project Standup and Progress
On Monday we gave a standup update on the progress on our project. We talked about what we worked on and what
issues we ran into. Since the previous standup we shifted from working on issues posted on the GitHub issues
page to contributing new lessons to the Rosetta Code programming section. We did this because there is a lot
of work to be done in that section and the work is much more consistent than waiting for new issues from the
issues page. We also talked about an issue with contributing new lessons to FreeCodeCamp, the maintainers of
the project themselves could not decide whether a new issue should be raised for every lesson contributed. The
course of action that we decided to go with is creating a blanket issue for adding missing lessons from Rosetta
Code and reference that issue with the pull requests that we make. During our weekly meeting we discussed what 
lessons we are planning on working on.
