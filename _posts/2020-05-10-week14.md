# Reflections on Project Progress and Final Presentation
During this week we continued making progress on our project. We've received some comments on some of the pull requests
and we worked on implementing suggested changes. Some Pull Requests that Anastasia made were merged in. Kyla is working
on merging lessons from an abandoned project into the main project. During our weekly meeting on Wednesday we started working
on our presentation for the following Monday. We decided to talk about what freeCodeCamp is, our experiences interacting
with the community, our specific contributions, as well as challenges we ran into while working on this project.
